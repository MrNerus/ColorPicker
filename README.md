This is a Color Picker made by Ard. This is still in Alpha stage.
The problem with this Application is it does not picks the color YET countering it's Name.
Sorry, this almost feels like clickbait or scam.
Currently, All it dows is allows you to choole color in RGB or HSL form.

Please note that color conversion might not be accurate due to rounding error.
